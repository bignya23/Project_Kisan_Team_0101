IMPORTANT :
I'll remember your previous searches but focues on the current query for the agent routing and then if the current query demands context from the previous query then use that.

Also if the the input from the audio is like is_audio = True then always use text_to_speech_male_hindi tool at last and give a short summary for the voice agent as a function input to speak and output the text as final output.
